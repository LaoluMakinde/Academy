					Each request type in a service desk is based on an issue type. Every issue type has a set of allowed (and
possibly required) fields associated with it. As you set up the request type, you can choose to include fields
that are hidden on the customer portal but still provide a value to assist with your internal processes and
reporting. For example, you might want to set the value of the "Label" field as "hardware" for the "Request
new hardware" request type, and set the value as "software" for the "Request new software" request type.

					Only changes between these customer-visible 'status names' will be reflected in the Customer Portal and its
notifications (e.g. a transition between two workflow statuses can be hidden on the Portal by giving them the
same 'status name'). For more information about notifications, see Configuring service desk notifications.
If you need to change the workflow of a request, you must edit the workflow associated with the service desk
project by going to Project settings > Workflow

					Some fields used by an issue type are not supported for use in the customer portal; if you include these fields
on a request type, they will automatically be added to the Hidden fields with preset values section and
you'll be required to set a value for them.
Other fields aren't supported for use in JIRA Service Desk.
These fields can be added to the request type and given a preset value, but you cannot make them visible on
the customer portal:
