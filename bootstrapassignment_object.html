                    Managing queues
You can reorder or delete queues at any time by hovering over the Queues sidebar and selecting Manage. In
the Manage queues dialog that appears, you can see the number of issues in each queue, and drag and
drop queues to reorder them.
You can edit existing queues by selecting the queue you wish to configure and selecting Edit queue in the
top right corner. You can edit the queue name, the issues shown, the columns, and column order. Note that
you will see a live preview of the updated issues that appear in this queue as you configure it.
How your team uses queues
Queues give your agents a single view of the work that needs to be done across their team. Agents can view
all of the queues in your service desk project; however, they cannot create or edit queues.
Setting up request types
JIRA Service Desk provides a set of default request types that are
configured for basic IT help desk scenarios. You can configure the default
request types or add new ones to suit the needs of your customers and
team. Request types can be organized into groups to help customers find
the request they need on the customer porta

                    A single issue type can be the basis for many different request types (for example, the "Purchase" issue type
serves as the basis for both the "Request new hardware" and "Request new software" requests).
Organize request types into groups
We recommend using groups if you have seven or more request types, so you can make your request types
easier to find on the customer portal. You must have more than one group for the groups to appear in the
customer portal. For example: 'Access requests', 'General', and 'Purchase requests':
                </p>
                      <p>

                    You can also keep fields hidden but available on the request type so that their value can be used for other
processes. For more details about how different types of fields work in JIRA Service Desk, see Hidden fields
and unsupported fields.
If the issue type doesn't have the fields you need, you must add a field to the JIRA issue type that the
request type is based on. If the issue type uses multiple screen schemes, the new field must be available in
the create screen. See Associating a screen with an issue operation.
Customize the workflow statuses for a request type
JIRA Service Desk uses the workflow associated with the request's issue type for the flow of the request.

                    Hidden fields and unsupported fields
Each request type in a service desk is based on an issue type. Every issue type has a set of allowed (and
possibly required) fields associated with it. As you set up the request type, you can choose to include fields
that are hidden on the customer portal but still provide a value to assist with your internal processes and
reporting. For example, you might want to set the value of the "Label" field as "hardware" for the "Request
new hardware" request type, and set the value as "software" for the "Request new software" request type.
Some fields used by an issue type are not supported for use in the customer portal; if you include these fields
on a request type, they will automatically be added to the Hidden fields with preset values section and
you'll be required to set a value for them.
Other fields aren't supported for use in JIRA Service Desk.
These fields can be added to the request type and given a preset value, but you cannot make them visible on
the customer portal:
Assignee
Linked issues
Any fields that are defined by other JIRA applications
Group, project, and version picker custom fields
These types of fields can't be added to a request type and won't appear in the in the "Add a field" dialog:
